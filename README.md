Hy, i have created my website using react and i used third party libraries . so to install all of them you need to run the command "npm i" it will download all the dependencies.
after you download all the dependencies, you need to  run the command "npm run dev"
and there  you go . Now, you can access my website on localhost:5173.


My website is fully responsive , you can run it on any device. i put my best effort in making this project, hope you like it.ðŸ˜Š
